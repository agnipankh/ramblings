Amit is a computer Scientist by training... and aspires to be a plumber-philosopher. 

> “The society which scorns excellence in plumbing as a humble
activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is
an exalted activity will have neither good plumbing nor good
philosophy: neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water.”

> John W. Gardener
